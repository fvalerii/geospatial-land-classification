## Capstone Project: Geospatial Land Classification for Agriculture

### Project Overview
The capstone project, completed as part of the IBM Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow course, focuses on building and advanced land classification system for agricultural applications using satellite imagery.
The project simulates an AI Engineer role at a fertilizer company, where the core objective is to develop and rigorously compare state=of the=art deep learning models for accurately classifying terrain (e.g. crops, forests, water bodies)
The entire deep learning pipeline was implemented from custom geospatial data handling to comparative model analysis, showcasing expertise across leading deep learning frameworks.

### Deliverables and Core Achievements
1. Robust Deep Learning Model Development

    CNN Implementation: Developed and trained independent CNN models using both Keras and PyTorch to solve the land classification problem.

    Vision Transformer Integration:  Designed and implemented a hybrid deep learning model by integrating features from pre-trained CNNs and Vision Transformers. The entire combined architecture was then fine-tuned to optimize performance for the agricultural land classification task.

    Comparative Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive comparative study of CNNs and Hybrid CNN-Vision Transformer performance across the two major frameworks.

2. Full-Cycle Deep Learning Pipeline

    Data Handling: Implemented efficient techniques for geospatial image dataset loading and applied custom data augmentation strategies in both Keras and PyTorch.

    Model Evaluation: Rigorously evaluated all models using a suite of quantitative metrics, including F1​-score and AU-ROC, to ensure robust and reliable performance for a real-world application.

### Project Structure (Four Modules)
The project was structured across three modules, each focusing on a critical phase of deep learning development:

- Data Handling: Focus on efficient data loading (memory vs. generator) and building a custom geospatial data loader.

- CNN Development: Design, train, and evaluate CNN models in both Keras and PyTorch.
    
- CNN - Vision Transformer Integration: pre-trained CNN models were integrated with Vision Transformer models, and the resulting hybrid model was then fine-tuned for land classification.

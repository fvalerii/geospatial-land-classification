## Capstone Project: Geospatial Land Classification for Agriculture

### Project Overview
The capstone project, completed as part of the IBM Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow course, focuses on building and advanced land classification system for agricultural applications using satellite imagery.
The project simulates an AI Engineer role at a fertilizer company, where the core objective is to develop and rigorously compare state=of the=art deep learning models for accurately classifying terrain (e.g. crops, forests, water bodies)
The entire deep learning pipeline was implemented from custom geospatial data handling to comparative model analysis, showcasing expertise across leading deep learning frameworks.

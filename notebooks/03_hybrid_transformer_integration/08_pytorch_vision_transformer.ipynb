    "This research module implements a **Hybrid CNN-Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture using the PyTorch framework. Similar to the Keras implementation in Module 07, we utilize a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor to provide high-level spatial tokens to a Transformer encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technical Focus:**\n",
    "* **Deterministic Data Parity:** Utilizing a DataFrame-driven 80/10/10 split to ensure the model is trained and tested on the exact same images as the Keras baseline.\n",
    "* **Intermediate Spatial Hook:** Extracting tokens from an $8 \\times 8$ convolutional feature map to preserve spatial relationships for the Attention mechanism.\n",
    "* **Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN):** Implementing the transformer blocks with normalization before attention to ensure gradient stability.\n",
    "* **Cross-Framework Benchmarking:** Preparing model artifacts for final performance comparison in Module 09."

    "The **MHSA** class implements the self-attention mechanism that enables the Vision Transformer to model long-range dependencies and global context across all spatial locations in the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation follows the scaled dot-product attention formula: **Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d)V**, where Q, K, and V represent query, key, and value matrices, respectively. The scaling factor 1/sqrt(d) prevents the dot products from becoming too large, which would push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients.\n",

    "- **Unified QKV projection**: A single linear layer `nn.Linear(dim, dim*3)` generates Q, K, and V matrices efficiently, reducing memory overhead compared to separate projections\n",
    "- **Head reshaping**: The tensor is reshaped from (B, L, D) to (B, heads, L, d) where d = D/heads, enabling parallel processing across heads\n",
    "- **Attention computation**: Matrix multiplication `torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1))` computes attention scores, followed by scaling and softmax normalization\n",

It enables the model to look at all positions in the sequence (or image patches) at once, figuring out which ones are most important for each output. It’s like giving the model the power to focus on the key parts of an image or sentence.\n",

    "- Dropout for regularization (helps prevent overfitting).\n",
    "- Another linear layer that shrinks the data back to the original dimension.\n",
    "- Another dropout layer.\n",
    "Here, MLP is designed to help the model learn better representations by combining and transforming the information after the attention step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip/Residual connections (x + ...):** These connections support effective and stable training for deep neural networks by keeping pathways open for both forward information flow and backward gradient flow, making deep architectures such as transformers possible and practical. In transformers, skip connections are placed around both the attention and feedforward (MLP) sub-layers in each block. This stabilizes training of these very deep, stackable models, improves convergence speed, and lets them scale to larger datasets and more complex tasks.\n",

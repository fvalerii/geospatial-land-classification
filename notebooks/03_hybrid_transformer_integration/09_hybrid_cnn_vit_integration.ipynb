    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic Data Isolation:** Reconstructing the exact 80/10/10 split from Module 07/08 to ensure the models are tested on a \"Gold Standard\" dataset that remained untouched during all training phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Framework Weight Injection:** Demonstrating technical proficiency in re-initializing custom Transformer layers and loading weight artifacts (`.weights.h5` and `.pth`) into newly instantiated architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparative Performance Audit:** Utilizing advanced statistical metrics (F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Log-Loss) to determine if the Hybrid-ViT offers a significant improvement in geospatial robustness over previous CNN baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inference Consistency Check:** Verifying that both frameworks converge on the same classification logic, proving the Hybrid architecture is a robust, framework-independent solution."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This research module presents an end-to-end workflow for importing, testing, and evaluating two Vision Transformer (ViT) models developed in Keras and PyTorch, respectively. \n",
    "The self-attention mechanism in the ViTs allows these models to learn complex and broad spatial dependencies, providing improved performance on a variety of vision tasks compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. However, the CNNs are adept in learning the local features very well and can be trained using relatively smaller datasets and is generally much more efficient in utilizing the computational resources, as compared to ViTs. A CNN-ViT hybrid architecture gains from both CNN and ViT model strengths, by getting local features extracted using CNNs, while the transformer part of the hybrid architecture can determine the global dependencies."

    "**Study Synthesis:** This 9-part series has demonstrated the evolution of geospatial land classification from standard CNN baselines to advanced Hybrid CNN-ViT architectures. By integrating the local texture extraction of CNNs with the global relational learning of Transformers, we achieved a significant increase in classification robustness. The final benchmark proves that both Keras and PyTorch implementations reach near-parity in performance ($>99\\%$ accuracy), confirming that the Hybrid architecture is a framework-agnostic solution for complex remote sensing tasks."
